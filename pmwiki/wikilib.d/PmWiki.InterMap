text=The InterMap is a system for defining links between WikiWikiWeb sites that was first developed by UseMod:UseModWiki and Meatball:MeatballWiki.  InterMap links have the form [=HostPrefix:Page=], where the host prefix is converted to a partial URL based on entries in the site's @@intermap.txt@@ and @@localmap.txt@@ files.께The default @@intermap.txt@@ distributed with PmWiki includes the following InterMap entries: [=   PmWiki          http://www.pmichaud.com/wiki/PmWiki/    Wiki            http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?    Meatball        http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?    UseMod          http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?    ISBN            http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/    Wikipedia       http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/=]쾆hus, PmWiki:Variables becomes a link to the PmWiki.{{Variables}} page on the official PmWiki web site, Wiki:FrontPage is a link to the front page of the first WikiWikiWeb, and Wikipedia:Stonehenge takes you to the Wikipedia article about the famous megaliths in England.께InterMap links can be used to link to non-wiki pages: %newwin% ISBN:020171499X  %% is a link to Amazon.com's entry for ''The Wiki Way'' by Bo Leuf and Ward Cunningham (an excellent book about {{WikiWikiWeb}}s in general).께In addition, PmWiki provides three special InterMap links: @@[=ThisPage=]@@, @@[=ThisGroup=]@@, and @@[=ThisWiki=]@@ provide URI-shortcuts to the current wiki page, group, or wiki site respectively.  Thus, an edit link can be written as ThisPage:?action=edit, or a link to set group passwords can be written as ThisGroup:GroupAttributes?action=attr.께The actual set of InterMap links at any site is defined by the site administrator; for more details, see PmWiki.{{CustomInterMap}}s.께%trail%<<|PmWiki.DocumentationIndex|>>께
