text=!Uninstalling PmWiki께Most of the files created and/or used by PmWiki can be deleted by the account holder outright. However, a certain system file, created when the @@wiki.d@@ directory is created, cannot be removed this way. To remove @@wiki.d@@, create a PHP file containing the following line:께@@ [= <?php system ('/bin/rm -rf wiki.d') ?> =] @@께Place the file in your PmWiki directory and call it up in your browser. No output will be produced, but the @@wiki.d@@ directory and all of the pages within it will be gone. '''*Forever*'''.  So, make sure you want to do this before you try.께Once this has been completed, the account holder should be able to delete the PmWiki directory with no further complaints from the server.께%trail%<<|PmWiki.DocumentationIndex|>>
