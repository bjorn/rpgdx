text=Here are some quick instructions on how to download and install PmWiki.  Improvements to these instructions would be greatly appreciated. If you encounter problems during installation process take a look at TroubleShooting.께1. Download the latest version of PmWiki ([[$Version]]) from http://www.pmichaud.com/pub/pmwiki.께2. Extract the tar image using "@@tar xvfz pmwiki.tgz@@" .  This will create a @@pmwiki-x.y.z@@ directory which contains the PmWiki software.  Rename this directory to "pmwiki" by executing "@@mv pmwiki-x.y.z pmwiki@@" . The files in this directory include          pmwiki.php      Main PmWiki script          pmwiki-50.gif   PmWiki logo          wikilib.d/      Directory containing some default PmWiki files          scripts/        Some sample configuration scripts          local/          A directory for local configuration scripts쾆hese files need to be placed where they can be accessed by a web server (e.g. in a ''public_html'' directory of some sort).  께3. Temporarily change the permissions on the directory containing @@pmwiki.php@@ directory to 2777.  In Unix this is normally done by changing to the directory containing @@pmwiki.php@@ and executing "@@chmod 2777 .@@" (note the dot at the end).  This will (1) make the directory writable so the web server can create the data directory it needs for the wiki files, and (2) preserve group ownership of the directory so the installer account can manipulate the files created in this directory.께4. If you're running Apache version 2.0.30 or later, you may need to set the [=AcceptPathInfo=] directive to "on" for the @@pmwiki.php@@ script.  This can be as simple as adding    [=AcceptPathInfo on=]쾢o either the @@.htaccess@@ file in the directory containing @@pmwiki.php@@ or the server's @@httpd.conf@@ file.  If changing the @@httpd.conf@@ file, don't forget to restart Apache to have the change take effect.께5. Open a web browser to the @@pmwiki.php@@ script.  When @@pmwiki.php@@ is first executed, it creates the @@wiki.d@@ directory for holding wiki pages with appropriate ownership and permissions.  Once @@wiki.d@@ has been created, the  directory permissions can be set back to 755 or whatever you prefer to use (e.g., execute "@@chmod 755 .@@").께6.  Check out InitialSetupTasks for other tasks you may want to perform to begin customizing your PmWiki installation.  You might also want to peruse the ReleaseNotes for further information.께7. Take care that there is enough space on your filesystem. If not, any editing action will delete the page you have just edited. There is no ErrorMessages and page revision is not possible because the file is not saved at all.께----께Illiterate end user remark: Great Job! But isn't it possible to have a self-installing prefigured binary, to install from Midnight Commander with F2 Install Package command? Supposedly for a programmer installing pmWiki is easy, but for an end user it is not.께%trail%<<|PmWiki.DocumentationIndex|>>
