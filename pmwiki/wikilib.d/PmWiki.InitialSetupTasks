text=Once you have PmWiki up and running on your site (see PmWiki.{{Installation}}), you may want to begin customizing PmWiki for your particular needs.  Most PmWiki customizations are performed in a file called @@local.php@@, which should go in the '''same directory''' that contains the @@pmwiki.php@@ file.께When you first install PmWiki, the @@local.php@@ file will not exist and so you'll have to create one if you want to perform any local customizations.  You can either create @@local.php@@ from scratch following the instructions below, or you can copy the @@sample-local.php@@ file (in the @@scripts/@@ subdirectory) and use it as a starting point.께Here is a very simple @@local.php@@ file:  [=<?php  $WikiTitle = "MyNewWiki";  $WikiImgUrl = "http://www.example.com/mylogo.gif";?>=]콾ote that @@local.php@@ should always begin with @@<?php@@ and end with @@?>@@.  Be sure there aren't any blank lines or spaces before the @@<?php@@ or after the @@?>@@, or else you'll get strange PHP error messages at the beginning of your wiki pages.께The @@local.php@@ file above is setting the value of two PHP variables used by PmWiki.  The [=$WikiTitle=] variable gives the name of your site as it will appear in a user's browser title bar.  The [=$WikiImgUrl=] variable specifies the URL of the icon image that will appear by default in the upper-left corner of each wiki page.  PmWiki lets you set these (and other) variables in @@local.php@@ so that you can change the look and feel of PmWiki from its default, sometimes substantially so.  You can look at PmWiki.{{Variables}} for a list of variables that PmWiki uses, and also at PmWiki:PmWikiUsers for examples of other sites that are using PmWiki in customized ways.께After you've set up an initial @@local.php@@ file, you can then begin to look at other LocalCustomizations you may wish to make to your wiki site.  Don't forget to [[http://www.pmichaud.com/lists/pmwiki-users join the pmwiki-users mailing list]], where you can email other {{WikiAdministrator}}s for help on customizing PmWiki and participate in discussions about PmWiki improvements.  And, once you have your site operational, be sure to add it to PmWiki:PmWikiUsers so others will know about it!께%trail%<<|PmWiki.DocumentationIndex|>>께
