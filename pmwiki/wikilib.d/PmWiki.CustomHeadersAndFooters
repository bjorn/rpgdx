text=This page describes how you can change the default headers and footers that appear on PmWiki pages.  Setting the headers and footers is usually done by changing the value of {{variables}} in the @@local.php@@ file (described in InitialSetupTasks and LocalCustomizations).께This page is being updated to reflect the new variable structure used in pmwiki-0.5 and later.  Versions of PmWiki prior to 0.5 may want to look [[PmWiki:CustomHeadersAndFooters4 here]].께The basic appearance of a page in PmWiki is controlled by the $PageHeaderFmt and $PageFooterFmt variables.  $PageHeaderFmt specifies the HTML markup to be output after the HTML <body> tag but before the contents of the wiki page itself.  $PageFooterFmt specifies the HTML markup after the contents of the wiki page but before the closing </body> tag.  To change the page layout to contain only a simple title at the top and an "Edit Page" link at the bottom, one could do (in ''local.php''):    $PageHeaderFmt = '<h1>$Title</h1><hr />';    $PageFooterFmt = '<hr /><small><a href="$PageUrl?action=edit">Edit      Page</a></small>';콮oth of these variables (and most PmWiki variables ending in 'Fmt') are processed for global $-variable substitutions prior to being output.  Thus,  @@$Title@@ and @@$PageUrl@@ in the above statements will be replaced with the title of the page and the URL of the page when the values are output.께$PageHeaderFmt and $PageFooterFmt also allow the HTML output to come from a file on disk, an administrator-defined PHP function, or another wiki page.  For example, one can create a file called ''local/myheader.html'' with the markup for the HTML page header, and then include the contents of that file as the header by specifying    $PageHeaderFmt = [='file:local/myheader.html'=];콿ther examples include:    [=$PageHeaderFmt = 'file:local/myheader.php';    # include a php file    $PageHeaderFmt = 'function:MyHeaderFunction';  # a user-defined function    $PageHeaderFmt = 'wiki:$Group.PageHeader';     # a per-group PageHeader wiki page =]께Finally, any of these variables can be arrays of values to be output, allowing combinations of the above.  For example    [=$PageHeaderFmt = array(      '<h1>$Group.$Title</h1><table><tr><td width="20%">',      'wiki:$Group.LeftMenu',      '</td><td>');    $PageFooterFmt = '</td></table>';=]쾥ill display a page with the group name and title at the top, followed by a two-cell HTML table with the contents of the [=LeftMenu=] page in the left cell and the contents of the wiki page in the right cell.께See PageLayout for more details about the organization and structure of pages produced by PmWiki.께%trail%<<|PmWiki.DocumentationIndex|>>께
