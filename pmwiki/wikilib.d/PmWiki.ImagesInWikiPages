text=To place an image inside a wiki page, simply enter the address (URL) of the image you want to include.  For example, the URL @@[=http://www.pmichaud.com/toast/ptart-1c.gif=]@@ displays in the text as께http://www.pmichaud.com/toast/ptart-1c.gif께All [=URLs=] ending in .gif, .jpg, .jpeg, and .png are automatically treated as image placeholders in PmWiki.  The position of the image URL in a line determines how it will display in the page:* an image URL at the beginning of a line displays the image at the left margin with text wrapped to the right* an image URL at the end of a line displays the image at the right margin with text wrapped to the left* an image URL in the middle of a line displays the image in line with the text* an image URL on a line by itself is displayed by itself께The special markup [=[[<<]]=] can be used to tell PmWiki to skip to a point below any floating images.께Images must be stored on a webserver somewhere in order to be displayed in PmWiki.  If the system has been configured to enable {{uploads}}, then you can upload an image as a page attachment and include it using the @@[=Attach:=]@@ markup.  Otherwise, HowToUploadImages describes the process of uploading images to a webserver.께Images may be specified as the target of a link using the double brackets markup by specifying an image URL as the text for a link (see LinksToExternalPages).  For example, the image to the right of this paragraph is a link to the Strawberry Pop-Tart Blow-Torches page.
