text=From its inception, PmWiki has been designed so that {{WikiAdministrator}}s can greatly customize the way PmWiki displays pages and the markup sequences used to generate pages.  (This is even mentioned explicitly in PmWikiPhilosophy #4.)  As a result, the core @@pmwiki.php@@ script makes extensive use of PmWiki.{{Variables}} to determine how markup sequences will be processed and what each individual page will output.  Thus, a WikiAdministrator can make a lot of customizations simply by setting variables in the @@local.php@@ file.께The bulk of this page describes how customizations work in general, see PmWiki.DocumentationIndex for specific customizations that are commonly performed at many PmWiki installations, including:* ChangePmWikiURL* CustomHeadersAndFooters* CustomMarkup* {{CustomInterMap}}s* {{Robots}}께The @@scripts/@@ subdirectory (below the directory holding the @@pmwiki.php@@ script) contains many example customizations that you can include in your @@local.php@@ site configuration.  The first few lines of each of these scripts generally contains instructions about how to enable (and use) the feature provided by the script--for most scripts, simply adding a line like        include_once("script/''scriptfile.php''");쾖n the @@local.php@@ file will enable it.  Some of the scripts are automatically enabled for you via the @@scripts/stdconfig.php@@ script unless you disable them by setting @@[=$EnableStdConfig=0=]@@ in @@local.php@@.께Note that you should strongly resist the temptation to directly modify the @@pmwiki.php@@ script or the scripts in the @@scripts/@@ subdirectory.  Any modifications you make to these files will probably be overwritten whenever you perform a PmWiki.{{Upgrade|s}}.  Instead, look at some of the sample scripts for examples of customizations that can be performed from @@local.php@@. You can even create your own script to do a customization and use @@include_once(...)@@ to include it from @@local.php@@.  If you do make your own customization script, you can safely put it in the @@local/@@ subdirectory (it won't get overwritten by an upgrade there).  You might also want to submit your customization to the [[http://www.pmichaud.com/lists/pmwiki-users pmwiki-users mailing list]] or the [[http://www.pmichaud.com/wiki/Cookbook/ PmWiki.Cookbook]] so that others can benefit from your effort and so that it can perhaps be included in future releases of PmWiki.께<<|PmWiki.DocumentationIndex|>>
